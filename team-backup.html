				<p>Finding home health care for a loved one can be challenging. The hardest part is finding a senior living team
					in Grand Rapids and West Michigan that you can trust. Here at Care Cardinal, our qualified teams treat your
					family like our family. After all, it doesn't take long before they become our family too.</p>
				<p>Unlike traditional senior assisted living or senior living apartments, our homes are intimate spaces where
					residents from all walks of life come together to live. We cook together, play games together, and most
					importantly, we care for each other.</p>
